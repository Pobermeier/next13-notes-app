This is a version of the [Server-Components Demo-Application](https://github.com/reactjs/server-components-demo) (build and released by the React Core-Team in December 2020) rebuild with Next.js 13.

The API for this project was implemented with JSON-server and can be found [here](https://github.com/Pobermeier/next13-notes-app-api).

A hosted version of this project, can be found [here](https://next13-notes-app.vercel.app/note/m_LJ1lo7IdcNsNfs-CSF9), however the hosted app is currently not functioning properly due to some issues with routing and server components, so it is recommended to run the application on your local machine.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or with experimental Turbo-support:

```bash
npm run dev:turbo
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
