This is a version of the [Server-Components Demo-Application](https://github.com/reactjs/server-components-demo) (build and released by the React Core-Team in December 2020) rebuild with Next.js 13.

For simplicity sake there is no DB involved and the notes are just stored in plain memory and can be fetched & mutated via the api-routes implemented in `pages/api`.

A live version of this project can be found [here](https://next13-notes-app.vercel.app/).

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
